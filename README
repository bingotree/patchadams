HISTORY 

After using git add/commit with the --patch option, I wanted to be able to have the same
interactive patch functionality.

When searching for programs to do this, I found the options to be surprisingly lacking.

'sdiff' came up the most in searches. But this wasn't what I wanted, the
format wasn't intuitive and reading the output difficult.

So I made a simple proof of concept, which splits a diff into hunks, then interactively
prompts the user to apply them or not.

So patchadams is two programs, a diff-splitter (splitpatch) and a interactive patch prompt.

Currently splitpatch supports unified diff format, and should work with git diff.

FUTURE GOALS

- Option to save hunkfiles to a specific location
- Option to edit hunks
- Combine accepted hunks into one file, then apply at the end.
